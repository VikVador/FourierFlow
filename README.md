In this repository, you will find the code for the Fourier Neural Operators as well as the Factorized Fourier Neural Operators. The reason behind the creation of this repository is that I wanted something simpler and more convenient to install than what was available online.

                            Zongyi Li and Daniel Zhengyu Huang

 This code is based on the papers :

                        Factorized Fourier Neural Operators
                        (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13802)

                Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations
                            (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895)

Installation
</p>
<hr>
You can simply install this library using the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/VikVador/FourierFlow
```

be careful that you should already have torch, numpy and einops installed in your envs.
